## NODEPOP v.1 Feature Summary

In this first version of the NODEPOP application, for buying and selling between individuals, we can do the following operations:

`Create` an item from the main view

`Filters`
- By name to search for a certain item if we know the exact name
- We can filter and ask it to show us all the articles that start with a certain letter or that contain a certain string of characters
- We can filter by type of operation, if we only want to see Sale or Purchase operations
Filter by Tags, to see articles related to a certain tag
- By price range-
- We can paginate and limit the number of articles per page

If we have the 'id' number of the article, we can search for it directly, update it or delete it.

We can also select the fields that we want to be shown in the results (_next implementation in the application view_)

To see all the available items, this is the URL ‚Üí `http://localhost:3000/api/products`

This is the list of URLs to access the code's functionalities. The API is mounted under the prefix /api/products:


**?name=value**

```json
http://localhost:3000/api/products?name=Airpods
```

**?sale=true|false**

```json
http://localhost:3000/api/products?sale=false
```

**?tags=tag1,tag2**

```json
http://localhost:3000/api/products?tags=work&tags=motor
```

**?fields=fields1,fields2**

```json
http://localhost:3000/api/products?fields=name&fields=price
```

**?minPrice=50** & **?maxPrice=100**

```json
http://localhost:3000/api/products?minPrice=50&maxPrice=110
```

**?searchType=startsWithLetter=a**

```json
http://localhost:3000/api/products?searchType=startsWith&searchTerm=m
```

**?searchType=containsString=search**

```json
http://localhost:3000/api/products?searchType=contains&searchTerm=pro
```

**?skip=5** & **?limit=10**

```json
http://localhost:3000/api/products?skip=2&limit=4
```

**?sortByPrice=asc || ?sortByPrice=desc**

```json
http://localhost:3000/api/products?sortByPrice=asc
http://localhost:3000/api/products?sortByPrice=desc
```

**Get an individual product:**

`http://localhost:3000/api/products/:id` (replace :id with the ObjectId of the product)

**Get List existing tags:**

`http://localhost:3000/api/products/tags/existing`

```json
http://localhost:3000/api/products/tags/existing
```

```json
{
  "tags": ["lifestyle", "mobile", "motor", "work"]
}
```

`PUT (Update data):`

**Update a product:**`

`http://localhost:3000/api/products/:id`
(PUT method, sending the updated data in the body of the request)

`POST (Create data):`

**Create a new product:**

`http://localhost:3000/api/products `
(POST method, sending the data of the new product in the body of the request)

`DELETE (Delete data):`

**Delete a product:**
`http://localhost:3000/api/products/:id `
(DELETE method)

These URLs assume that your API is running on a local server on port 3000. If your configuration is different, adjust the URLs accordingly.
The format of the data to be sent in the POST and PUT requests must be JSON, following the structure of the Products collection in your Mongoose database.

### Future Improvements
This is the first version of the application, and further enhancements are planned to enhance its functionality and user experience. Some of the improvements planned for future versions include:

`Combining Filters:` Implementing the ability to combine multiple filters for more refined search results, providing users with greater flexibility and precision in their product searches.

`Tag List Visualization:` Enhancing the user interface by displaying a list of available tags on the screen, allowing users to easily navigate through product categories and filter their search results based on specific tags. Additionally, each tag will be linked to the corresponding articles with those tags, providing users with seamless navigation and access to relevant products.
